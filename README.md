# Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects

In this Nanodegree Program we're using Python, SQL, and statistics to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.

## Projects List:

-   Project 1: Exploring Weather Trends

In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global temperatures

--------------------------------------------------------

-   Project 2: TMDb Movie Data Analysis

Investigate a dataset analyzes a dataset and then communicate the findings.

--------------------------------------------------------V

-   Project 3: Analyze AB Test Results

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

--------------------------------------------------------

-   Project 4: Analyze Twitter Data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

-   Project 5: Communicate Data Findings (Ford GoBike Data)

Communicate Data Findings deals with data exploration of the flight's cancellation and delay dataset mainly using data visualization and presenting the findings using explanatory visualizations.
